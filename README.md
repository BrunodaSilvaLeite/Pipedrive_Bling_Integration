## ✏️ Objective

Building a RESTful API using NodeJS technology.

## 📝 Requirements

✅ Create test accounts on Pipedrive and Bling platforms.

✅ Create an integration between the Pipedrive and Bling platforms (The integration should look for opportunities with status equal to won in Pipedrive, then enter them as an order in Bling).

✅ Create Mongo database, there are services like MongoDB Atlas to create for free.

✅ Create a collection in the MongoDB database aggregating the opportunities entered in Bling by day and total amount.

✅ Create endpoint to bring in the consolidated data from the MongoDB collection.

## 🧑‍💻 Project

The "Pipedrive and Bling Integration", is an integration that aims to test my skills to be part of the amazing [LinkApi](https://www.linkapi.solutions/). The API searches Pipedrive for Opportunities with a status of Won and passes the information as a Purchase Order to Bling. Integration is done with: NodeJS 📗, Javscript 📒, Express 📗, MongoDB 📗, Bling API 📘  and Pipedrive API 📕

## 🚀 Technologies
